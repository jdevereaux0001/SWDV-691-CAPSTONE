2)  Provide a list of objects that can be used in Javascript and provide an example of each.

String object - used to manipulate text.  The most common string objects I've used include concat(), substr(), search(), link(), bold(), fontcolor(), and fontsize(), but
you can also display blinking text with blink(), translate strings with fromCharCode(), or create a HTML anchor with anchor().

Date object - used to retrieve, set, and manipulate dates and times.  The most common date objects I've used include getDate(), getTime(), getMonth(), getYear(), and then
similar objects by replacing the work 'get' with 'set'.

Boolean object - used in conditional processing to determine a decision.  Common values are most commonly true/false but could also be yes/no, on/off, or any other combinations
of opposites.  Objects include tostring() and valueOf().

Math object - used to perform mathematical calculations, which are more indepth than just simple add, subtract, multiple and divide.  Objects include Math.sqrt(), Math.cos(),
Math.abs(), Math.min(), Math.max(), Math.round(), Math.exp(), and a host of others.

Array object - used to store a collection of data, comparable to a table or a spreadsheet.  The object type is Array() with additional methods such as array.concat(), array.filter(),
array.join(), array.pop(), array.push(), array.reverse(), and host of others.

Event object - used to perform actions or trigger events to occur.  Most common objects include onclick, onsubmit, onfocus, onmouseover, onload, onselect, and a host of others.
